# Roguelike

This is an untitled roguelike project. It features turn based movement and combat. It is being developed for Android.

## TODO

* [ ] Get the character equipping items
* [ ] Make the UI pixel perfect
* [ ] Make the UI suitable for mobile
* [ ] Remove AccessPoints in exchange for a simple Vector2Int
* [ ] Specify the position of 'access points' and their height / width so coridoors aren't always central to one another and are of different sizes
* [ ] Make weapon animations use animation curves so we don't have to draw every sprite frame
* [ ] Review NPC behaviour code
* [ ] Review block and miss code

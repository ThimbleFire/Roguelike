# Roguelike

This is an untitled roguelike project. It features turn based movement and combat. It is being developed for Android.

## Combat

### Block

Enemys with shields have a static 35% chance to block. The player character block rate is determined by their shield. Shield block rates range between 25% and 55%, and can be further enhanced with affixes on the shield.
Blocking can reduce incoming damage up to 100%.
Upon blocking, entities can not block again for 5 turns. This number can be reduced with block recovery affixes.

### Evasion

Evasion results in the attacker missing a melee or physical-ranged attack.
